## 🎓 **BOOTCAMP SKILLS DEMONSTRATION:**

### **Python Programming Proficiency:**
```python
# Applied bootcamp Python concepts in our incident detection system:

# Variables and Data Types (Day 2)
incident_type = "Medical Emergency"  # string
confidence_score = 0.87  # float  
timestamp = datetime.now()  # datetime
is_critical = True  # boolean

# Conditional Logic for Alert Routing (Day 2)
if incident_type == "Medical Emergency":
    alert_recipients = ["security@school.edu", "nurse@school.edu", "principal@school.edu"]
elif incident_type == "Fire/Smoke Detection":
    alert_recipients = ["security@school.edu", "fire@emergency.gov"]
else:
    alert_recipients = ["security@school.edu"]

# Loops for Camera Monitoring (Day 2)
for camera_id in active_cameras:
    frame_data = process_camera_feed(camera_id)
    if detect_incident(frame_data):
        send_alert(incident_data)

# Algorithm Implementation (Day 3)
def binary_search_incident(incidents, target_timestamp):
    # O(log n) search for efficient incident lookup
    low, high = 0, len(incidents) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if incidents[mid]['timestamp'] == target_timestamp:
            return mid
        elif incidents[mid]['timestamp'] < target_timestamp:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```
